Rest- API application with recycler view implementation and view Pager too. navigation is done using the navigation components and arguments are past between screens using the safe args capability of the navigation component. network state is properly managed using a seperate util class and the application architecture is MVVM(model view view-model). the view model is used to make te network call and it is propely tested. apploading state is well managed.
run the app to install and wait for the response as it loads, if there is a network connection the API information loads and if not there is a no connection screen displayed

for future improvements: a serchview will be implemented to allow specific searches, application of mockito for UI test
